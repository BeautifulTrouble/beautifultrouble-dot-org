========================

Web site for Beautiful Trouble Web toolbox.

### Instructions for development

* Clone the repository
* Enter directory
* 'git submodule init' && 'git submodule update' to get the submodules
* If you want the graphics locally, you'll need a copy of the wp-content/uploads/ directory (I typically just symlink to this)
* You'll also need a copy of the wp-config.php file, which -- for obvious reasons -- is not in the repository
* Last but not least, you'll need an up-to-date copy of the database
* That's it, now you should have a fully functional copy of the site
