	<h1>Alternate Text in a Pull-Quote</h1>
	<p>If you want certain pull-quotes to differ from the actual text in the &lt;span&gt;, turn on the "Use alternate text if available" option, then put the desired quotation in an HTML comment, like so:<br /><code>&lt;span class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;!-- This is a pullquote --&gt;This, with some extra text we don't want, is a pullquote&lt;/span&gt;</code>.</p>
	<p>If you are using the rich-text editor, you will have to click the "HTML" button to see the source code in order to do this.</p>
	<p>Please note that you may not put a double dash ("--") in an HTML comment, as that ends the comment and will cause some weirdness on your page.  This is a standard (if little-known) rule of HTML, and is not caused by this plugin.</p>
	<div style="border: 1px solid black; margin: 0px; padding: 0 1em;">
		<p><strong>CAUTION:</strong> In rare cases (including older versions of Safari) alternate pull-quote text does not display.  Assuming some of your readers might use a browser with this bug, you have two choices:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Do the alternate text as described.  The buggy browsers will show the <em>actual</em> text in the span as though the alternate were not there.</li>
			<li>Put the comment <em>alone</em> in a pullquote span, just before the sentence you're (sort of) quoting.  The buggy browsers will not show any pullquote at all, but other browsers will work normally. Example:  <code>&lt;span class="pullquote"&gt;&lt;!-- Darn that browser! -->&lt;/span&gt;Darn that JavaScript-mangling browser!</code></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Please note that in either case, things will display normally in browsers that read the JavaScript correctly.</p>
