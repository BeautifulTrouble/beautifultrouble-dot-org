== Description ==
This plugin make it easy, Quicktags add to the html - and visual-editor.. It is possible to ex- and import your Quicktags.

WP-AddQuicktag for WordPress is in originally by [Roel Meurders](http://roel.meurders.nl/ "Roel Meurders"). The versions of the Repo to AddQuicktag are newer versions, completly rewrite with version 2.0.0 and more functionalities.

The plugin add the quicktag on default to post types/ID `post`, `page` and `comment`. If you will also the plugin for other post types you can use a filter; see the follow example or an example plugin in the [Gist 1595155](https://gist.github.com/1595155).

	// add custom function to filter hook 'addquicktag_post_types'
	add_filter( 'addquicktag_post_types', 'my_addquicktag_post_types' );
	/**
	 * Return array $post_types with custom post types
	 * 
	 * @param   $post_type Array
	 * @return  $post_type Array
	 */
	function my_addquicktag_post_types( $post_types ) {
		
		$post_types[] = 'edit-comments';
		
		return $post_types;
	}

Also it is possible to filter the pages inside the backend. On default was the scripts include the pages `post.php`, `comment.php`. The follow example change this for an another page.

	add_filter( 'addquicktag_pages', 'my_addquicktag_pages' );
	/**
	 * Return array $page with custom page strings
	 * 
	 * @param   $page Array
	 * @return  $page Array
	 */
	function my_addquicktag_pages( $page ) {
		
		$page[] = 'edit-comments.php';
		
		return $page;
	}

See this Gist als example for add the Quicktags to the editor of comments: [Gist: 3076698](https://gist.github.com/3076698).
If you need the functionality, that the Quicktags of this plugin works on the Quickedit of comments as well, remove the `.example`-part of `addquicktag_quickedit_comment.php.example` filename. The file is a stand alone helper plugin for Add Quicktag and you'll need to activate this file (plugin) separately in 'Manage Plugins'.
