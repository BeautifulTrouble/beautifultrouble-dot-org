<!-- template="mla-taxonomies" -->
<!-- title="Taxonomies" order="2" -->
<p>If there are custom taxonomies, such as &#8220;Attachment Categories&#8221; or &#8220;Attachment Tags&#8221;, registered for attachments they will apppear in the right-hand column on this screen. You can add or remove terms from any of the taxonomies displayed. Changes will not be saved until you click the &#8220;Update&#8221; button for the attachment.</p>
<!-- template="mla-parent-info" -->
<!-- title="Parent Info" order="3" -->
<p>The &#8220;Parent Info&#8221; field displays the Post ID, type and title of the post or page to which the item is attached. It will display &#8220;0 (unattached)&#8221; if there is no parent post or page.</p>
<p>You can change the post or page to which the item is attached by changing the Post ID value and clicking the &#8220;Update&#8221; button. Changing the Post ID value to zero (0) will &#8220;unattach&#8221; the item.</p>
<!-- template="mla-mapping-actions" -->
<!-- title="Metadata Mapping" order="4" -->
<p>The &#8220;Map Custom Field Metadata&#8221; and &#8220;Map IPTC/EXIF Metadata&#8221; links let you create or update attachment values by applying the rules you define on the Media Library Assistant Settings page. The links are located in the &#8220;Save&#8221; metabox in the upper-right part of the screen, just below the Last Modified date and time.</p>
<p>When you click on one of the two links, all of the mapping rules for that type of metadata will be applied to the attachment you are editing. The updates are immediate; you do not need to click the &#8220;Update&#8221; button to make them permanent.</p>
