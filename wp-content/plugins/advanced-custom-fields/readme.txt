Advanced Custom Fields is the perfect solution for any wordpress website which needs more flexible data like other Content Management Systems. 

* Visually create your Fields

* Assign your fields to multiple edit pages (via custom location rules)
* Easily load data through a simple and friendly API
* Uses the native WordPress custom post type for ease of use and fast processing
* Uses the native WordPress metadata for ease of use and fast processing

= Field Types =
* Text (type text, api returns text)
* Text Area (type text, api returns text with `<br />` tags)
* WYSIWYG (a wordpress wysiwyg editor, api returns html)
* Image (upload an image, api returns the url)
* File (upload a file, api returns the url)
* Select (drop down list of choices, api returns chosen item)
* Checkbox (tick for a list of choices, api returns array of choices)
* Page Link (select 1 or more page, post or custom post types, api returns the url)
* Post Object (select 1 or more page, post or custom post types, api returns post objects)
* Date Picker (jquery date picker, options for format, api returns string)
